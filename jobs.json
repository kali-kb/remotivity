Table Bluff Farm is adjacent to the Ice Age Trail and consists of 8 acres of restored prairie, over 18 acres of woodlands, multiple flowers, and a large raised bed vegetable garden.  2 dogs, 10 chickens, a 0.4 acre stocked pond, and no livestock.  The primary project is framing and finishing an extension to a 610 sq foot entertainment room in my barn, currently finished with antique barn siding and beams and containing a kitchenette and full bathroom.  We will be adding a conservatory and bedroom to this suite.  Other projects include the construction of a large yoga/tent platform in the prairie, adding some additional raised beds, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will need to coordinate working side-by-side during the initial phases of these projects, but I anticipate independent work once things get going.

I have employed students as part-time summer gardening help on the farm for over 25 years, and our philosophy is to respect the school and other employment commitments of our hires and to try to make our employment needs as flexible for the employee as we can, and to try to have some fun together as well working on what for us are labors of love.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPay will include transportation time to and from the farm and an appropriate mileage fee for gas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EQualifications:\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic carpentry skills are a must, and some experience is desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EPhysical Demands\u003C/h3\u003E light labor -we'll need to pour some concrete post footers for instance.  \u003Ch3\u003EApplication Instructions:\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EEmail and/or phone\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Ch3\u003Emrwolff@medicine.wisc.edu\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E608-590-5447\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EContact:\u003C/h3\u003E Org: Table Bluff Farm\u003Cbr\u003EContact: Matthew Wolff MD\u003Cbr\u003EEmail: \u003Ca href=\"mailto:mrwolff@medicine.wisc.edu\"\u003Emrwolff@medicine.wisc.edu\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally posted on \u003Ca href=\"https://himalayas.app\"\u003EHimalayas\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
